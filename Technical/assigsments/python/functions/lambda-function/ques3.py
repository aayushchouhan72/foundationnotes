# 3.
#  Online Shopping Discount (Using filter() and map() with Lambda Expressions)

# An online shopping website is running a Festive Sale. Customers who purchase products worth ₹2,000 or more are eligible for a 20% discount.

# As a software developer, your task is to:

# Filter the prices of products that are ₹2,000 or more.
# Calculate the discounted price by applying a 20% discount.
# Display the final discounted prices.

# Note: Use filter() to identify eligible products and map() to calculate the discounted prices. Both operations must use lambda expressions.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of products.
# The second line contains N space-separated product prices.
# Output Format

# Display the discounted prices of all eligible products.

# Sample Input
# Enter the number of products:
# 6

# Enter the product prices:
# 1500 2500 1800 3000 4500 1200
# Sample Output
# Discounted Prices:
# 2000.0 2400.0 3600.0

prices=  list(map(int,input("Enter the buner ").split(" ")))

filtred= list(filter(lambda x:x>=2000,prices))

res=  list(map(lambda x:x-x*0.20,filtred))
